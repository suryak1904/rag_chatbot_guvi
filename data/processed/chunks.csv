Whether you are working with a simple unweighted graph or a complex weighted and directed one, understanding how to create, update, and maintain an adjacency matrix is an essential DSA skill. Let’s break down the entire process step by step using simple terms, clear explanations, and practical code examples. 1. Initialization The first step in creating an adjacency matrix is initializing the structure . If a graph has N vertices , you’ll need an N × N matrix (a two-dimensional array) where e"

If a graph has N vertices , you’ll need an N × N matrix (a two-dimensional array) where each cell represents a possible connection between two nodes. For unweighted graphs: You can initialize every cell with 0, meaning “no edge exists.” When you add an edge between two nodes, you’ll change the corresponding entries to 1. For weighted graphs: You usually initialize every cell with a large number like INF (infinity) or sometimes -1 to indicate “no connection.” If the graph allows self-l"

This setup makes it easy to modify and check connections later. 2. Adding an Edge Once your matrix is initialized, you can add an edge between two vertices. For an undirected graph: Since the connection goes both ways, you must update both [u][v] and [v][u] entries to 1 (or to th"

For a directed graph: The edge goes in one direction, so you only update [u][v] and leave [v][u] unchanged. Adding an edge takes O(1) time — meaning it’s instant, regardless of how large your graph is. 3. Removing an Edge To remove an edge , simply reset the corresponding entries in the matrix: In an unweighted graph , set the value back to 0. In a weight"

Checking if an Edge Exists The biggest advantage of an adjacency matrix is how fast you can check whether an edge exists between two nodes. You just look at the cell [u][v]: If it’s 1 (or any valid weight), an edge exists. If it’s 0 (or INF), no connection exists. This check happens in constan"

This check happens in constant time O(1) — one of the key reasons adjacency matrices are used in graph algorithms that require frequent lookups. 5. Iterating Through Neighbors To find all the neighbors (connected vertices) of a particular node, you can scan its entire row in the matrix. For example, to find all nodes connected to vertex u, check every column in row u and collect the indices where a connection exists (matrix[u"

This takes O(N) time per vertex because you have to check every possible node once. 6. Python Example Before jumping into the code, let’s understand what unweighted and weighted graphs mean. Unweighted Graph: In an unweighted graph, every edge is treated equally. It only shows whether a connection exists or not — there’s no concept of distance or cost. For example, if cities are connec"

For example, if cities are connected by roads but we don’t care about how long the roads are, it’s an unweighted graph. Weighted Graph: In a weighted graph, every edge has a specific value (weight) that represents cost, distance, or strength of connection. For example, if roads between cities have distances in kilometers, the distance becomes the weight of the edge. 1. Python code for unweighted graph # Adjacency matrix for unwei"

It is used to quickly test the presence of an edge between two nodes and to run matrix-friendly graph algorithms. 2. When should I prefer an adjacency list over an adjacency matrix? Prefer adjacency lists when the graph is sparse (E≪N2E \ll N^2E≪N2), because lists use O(N+E)O(N + E)O(N+E) space, are more memory efficient, and neighbor iteration is proportional to degree. 3.

How do weighted edges appear in the adjacency matrix? Instead of 1 and 0, a weighted adjacency matrix stores the weight value in matrix[u][v], and a sentinel (like INF) when no edge exists. 4. Can adjacency matrices handle directed graphs? Yes. For directed graphs the matrix is not necessarily symmetric; matrix[u][v] may differ from matrix[v][u]. 5.

That is why they appear in compilers, operating systems, runtime allocators,"

This fundamental characteristic allows arrays to efficiently exploit the addressing logic of computers. Think of an array as a row of boxes lined up side-by-side, each containing a value of the same type. The memory organization begins with what’s called the “base address” or “foundation address” – the memory location o"

Furthermore, all elements in a standard array must be of the same data type , ensuring each element occupies the same amount of memory. For example, an array of ten 32-bit integers might be stored at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, and so on. Additionally, each subsequent element is positioned exactly 4 bytes (the size of an integer) after the previous one, creating a neat,"

Once allocated, this size cannot be changed dynamically without creating an entirely new array and copying the elements. This constraint exists because of how memory is allocated for arrays.

React is using the DOM tree where it is applying the Diffing Algorithm for checking which node in the virtual DOM gets manipulated and updates only those nodes instead of re-rendering the whole page.

Direct Recursion A direct recursion occurs when a function in a data structure algorithm calls itself inside its own body. It progressively reduces the problem size with each call until the base condition halts further execution. Key Features: Function directly calls itself without involving another function. Simple to trace and debug because the call chain follows one path. Commonly used for problems that naturally divide into smaller versions of themselves. Example: def factorial

Establishing the Root Node The construction begins by creating the root node. It is the topmost node and has no parent. The root defines the starting point for all operations, such as insertion, traversal, or deletion. Every subsequent node is positioned based on its relationship to the root. 3. Node Insertion Process Insertion adds new nodes to the tree while maintaining its hierarchical integrity. Ident"

Identify the correct position for the new node under an existing parent. Attach the node as a left or right child based on the available link. Repeat the process for additional nodes to expand the structure. This step ensures that the tree remains connected and accessible from the root. 4.

Think of a subsequence as a “filtered” version of a sequence where you keep the remaining elements in the same order. You simply pick some elements (possibly all or none) and delete the others, but never reorder the picks. Formally: Definition: A subsequence of a sequence is a new sequence obtained by deleting zero or more elements without changing the relative order of the remaining elements. Example: Given the sequence ⟨A,B,C,D,E,F⟩, one subsequence is ⟨A,B,D⟩ (by deleting C, E,"

The straightforward method is a backtracking (pick/don’t pick) recursion: Idea: For each element of the sequence, you have two choices: include it in the current subsequence or skip it.

On reaching the end (index == len(s)), we have one complete subsequence. We backtrack by choosing not to include the current character as well.

Time Complexity: This method runs in O(2^n) time (and space) because it explores all subsequence combinations. It’s only practical for relatively small n . 2. Checking If One String is a Subsequence of Another Another common problem is: given strings s1 and s2, check if s1 is a subsequence of s2. A classic linear-time solution uses two pointers: Two-pointer approach: Let i point into s1 (the smaller string) and j into s2 (the larger). Traverse s2 with j. Whenever s1[i] =="

Traverse s2 with j. Whenever s1[i] == s2[j], advance i. Always advance j. At the end, if i has reached the length of s1, all its characters were matched in order, so s1 is a subsequence. Otherwise, it’s not. Example (Python code): def is_subsequence(small, large): i = 0 for ch in large: if i < len(small) and small[i] == ch: i += 1 return i == len(small) # Example usage: print(is_subsequence(""AXY"", ""ADXCPY"")) # True print(is_subsequenc"

Complexity: This runs in O(n+m) time (where n,m are string lengths) and O(1) extra space, which is optimal for this check. 3. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) The Longest Increasing S"

For example, in the array [3, 10, 2, 1, 20], the LIS is [3, 10, 20] of length 3. A simple DP solution (length O(n^2)) is: def LIS_length(arr): n = len(arr) dp = [1]*n # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at i for i in range(n): for j in range(i): if arr[j] < arr[i]: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp["

Heap Sort Heap sort uses the heap property to arrange elements in ascending or descending order.

Graph Algorithms Heaps are essential in graph-based algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path and Prim’s minimum spanning tree. They help in selecting the next edge or vertex with the minimum cost efficiently. Their logarithmic insertion and extraction times allow these algorithms

Step-by-Step Implementation of Heap Data Structure Step 1: Choose the Layout A heap uses a zero-indexed array to store its elements. This layout makes traversal and updates easier because the parent–child relationships follow direct index formulas. Example: If you insert values [10,5,3], they are stored as an array in the same order. This represents a complete binary tree where 10 is the root, 5 is the left child, and 3 is the right child.

Step 2: Fix the Index Formulas For any element at index i, its parent is at ⌊(i−1)/2⌋, its left child at 2i+1, and its right child at 2i+2. These relationships keep the tree consistent. Example: If the heap array is [10,7,5,3,2], the element 7 is at index 1. Its parent is 10 at index 0, and its children are 3 and 2 at indices 3 and 4.

Step 4: Insert a New Key Add the new value at the end to maintain completeness. Then use heapify-up to restore the heap property by comparing with its parent and swapping if required.

Step 5: Remove the Root The root is removed, and the last element replaces it. Then heapify-down restores order. Example: Removing the root 10 from [10,8,6,3,2,5] places 5 at the top, giving [5,8,6,3,2]. After heapify-down, the heap becomes [8,5,6,3,2]. St"

Example: If the heap is [10,8,6,3,2] and the value 8 becomes 12, it swaps upward until the heap property holds, resulting in [12,10,6,3,2].

Trees are used to represent hierarchical data and support efficient searching, sorting, and data organization. They form the foundation of databases, compilers, artificial intelligence , and countless algorithms that drive modern computing. Types of Tree Data Structure Below are the main types of tree data structures: 1. General Tree A general tree allows any number of children for each node. It represents complex hierarchies such"

It represents complex hierarchies such as file directories and taxonomy structures. The absence of a fixed branching limit gives it flexibility for storing varied relationships. 2. Binary Tree A binary tree restricts each node to have at most two children called the left child and the right child. This simple design supports fast searching and ordered traversal. Binary trees form the foundation for several specialized tree structures.

Together, properties and methods specify the entire behavior and characteristics of an object. The accessibility of properties and methods can differ based on visibility levels — public, private, or protected — to ensure data security and control.

Constructors and Destructors In PHP, a constructor is a special function that operates automatically when a new object is created. The primary purpose of this special function is to initialize property values and perform the setup tasks required for the object. Constructors are defined using the __construct() method.

This method or function is mainly used to clean up resources, such as freeing memory space or blocking database connections. Example: To gain control over an object’s lifecycle, these two (2) methods are used. Like in the case of a Car class entit"
